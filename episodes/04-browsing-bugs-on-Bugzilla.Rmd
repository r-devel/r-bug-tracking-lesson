## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.

There are three sections in this lesson:

 1. `questions`: displayed at the beginning of this episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives`: the learning objectives for this episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints`: displayed at the end of this episode to reinforce the
    objectives.
    
    
The remainder of this lesson is divided into several challenges that help you with browsing bugs on Bugzilla.

- Order the bug reports by date
- Keep the most recent at the top

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Will be added soon!
You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Challenge 4: Categorising the bug!

- Discuss your observations - can you categorise it as one of the following:
  - Bug Reporter misunderstands the function/documentation
  - Bug can not be reproduced.
  - Cause of bug is still being worked out.
  - Fix to bug is still being worked out/under debate.
  - A solution has been proposed by Bug Reporter or a Bug Reviewer and is waiting approval from R Core.
  - An R Core member has committed to implement the fix, but not yet done this.
  - Something else - please specify!
  
:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

Will be added soon!
You can add a line with at least three colons and a `solution` tag.

## Challenge 5: Categorising the bug according to what action needs to be taken next!

- Pick a bug with 1-2 comments (one that has had little response)
- Discuss your observations  - can you categorise it as one following, according to what action needs to be taken next?
  - Bug is actually a wish list item (suggested new feature) and should be recategorised/discussed.
  - Bug needs a (simpler) reproducible example.
  - Cause of bug not clear from report and needs investigation.
  - There is a proposed fix from the Bug Reporter that needs to be checked and reviewed.
  - Needs input on best way to fix from Bug Reviewer or R Core member.
  - How to fix is clear, but there is not yet a patch or commitment to fix.
  - Bug report has received a negative response (not a bug/not a welcome change) and should be closed.
  - Something else - please specify!
