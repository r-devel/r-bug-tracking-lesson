:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: questions 

- Have you tried searching bugs on [Bugzilla](https://bugs.r-project.org/) before?

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: objectives

- Before reporting a bug in R, we should first check if it has already been reported in Bugzilla
- Learning how to search a bug that is already reported on Bugzilla


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

## Introduction

This is a lesson created via The Carpentries Workbench. It is written in
[Pandoc-flavored Markdown][pandoc] for static files and
[R Markdown][r-markdown] for dynamic files that can render code into output. 
Please refer to the [Introduction to The Carpentries 
Workbench][carpentries-workbench] for full documentation.

There are three sections in this lesson:

 1. `questions`: displayed at the beginning of this episode to prime the
    learner for the content.
 2. `objectives`: the learning objectives for this episode displayed with
    the questions.
 3. `keypoints`: displayed at the end of this episode to reinforce the
    objectives.
    
    
The remainder of this lesson is divided into challenges that help you to understand how to report a bug related to using `rbind()` with `data.frames`.
